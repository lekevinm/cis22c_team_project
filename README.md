# cis22c_team_project

Beginner-level program that demonstrates the use of graphs to create a section of the United States
and color each state with none of its neighbors sharing the same color through the use of a backtracking algorithm.
Credits go to Frank M. Carrano, Tim Henry, and C. Lee-Klawender for some parts of the program.
